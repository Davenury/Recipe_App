### What is it?
Recipe App is a mobile app created to hold various recipes for five meals a day. It helps organizing your healthy diet, so you won't have to go through various files and mails to get everything in one place. You write recipes once and then get them for all time!


### Why?
Yeah, basically I told about it paragraph higher. It's just because I've been searching something that would help me go along with my diet and I won't have to scrool through the pdf files. I've also always wanted to learn some basics of Android Development, so... here it is!


### Technologies
* Kotlin as main programming language
* Android SDK
* Room Database to keep data
